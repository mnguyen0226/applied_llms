The plush is incredibly soft and cute, and my daughter carries it everywhere with her. However, I did notice that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems unintentional. While I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected given the price, I believe there are larger options available for the same cost. Despite this, the plush arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy it myself before gifting it to my daughter. Overall, it's a charming and cuddly companion that brings joy to both children and adults alike."
